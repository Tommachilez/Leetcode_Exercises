# Leetcode Exercises
A repo for storing Leetcode solutions and reports

## Convention
1. Each problem needs to have a separate folder.
2. Each folder needs to have 2 files: a solution file(.py) and a report.
3. All contributors must only commit their folders to their unique branch.
4. Push a folder **ONLY** when done adding a complete .py file and a report.
5. **DO NOT MERGE ANY BRANCH WITH THE MAIN BRANCH UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**.
